# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Project Name

**Author**: David Waiganjo
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This is a server application that use Auth0 technology to Authenticate a user and send responce to the client side app. The all has also incoprated used of NoSQL database to persist data

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

Need basic technologies to write a serverside app use Node.js and also reading through the Auth0 doc on server side implimentation. Reading on mongose Database is also critical

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

Languages used include JavaScript and technologies used include express, cors, jwt , jwkClients, mongo

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

08/15/2021 - This Application can send appropriate responses to the client side.
08/18/2021 This has intregrated use of NoSQL databse to persist data
08/22/2021 - The app allows books to be added and deleted from the database

## Credit and Collaborations
